# ✈️ AI-Powered Flight Scheduling at CSMIA

## 📌 Overview
Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) is the **world’s busiest single-runway airport**, handling over 55 million passengers annually.  
This project uses **AI-driven analysis and prediction** to identify congestion patterns, model delays, and suggest smarter scheduling strategies that can help reduce bottlenecks.  

The system also includes a **natural-language interface** so users can query results in plain English.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Flight Data Analysis** – cleaned and processed 1 week of operations from CSMIA.  
- ⏱️ **Delay Prediction Model** – interpretable regression model for departure delays.  
- 🔄 **Schedule Tuning** – suggests alternative departure times to minimize congestion.  
- 💬 **Natural-Language Queries** – simple Q&A for delay trends and critical flights.  
- 📂 **Open-Source & Modular** – easy to extend with weather or ATC feeds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Express  
- **Database**: SQLite + Prisma  
- **NLP**: Rule-based interface for natural queries
